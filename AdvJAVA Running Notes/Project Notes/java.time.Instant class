-Provided code snippet, the Instant class is used from the java.time package. 
-It represents a point in time, typically to nanosecond precision, independent of any particular time zone or calendar system.

Here's an explanation of each field in the AuthenticationResponse class:

1) authenticationToken: 
-Represents the authentication token generated during the authentication process.

2) refreshToken: 
-Represents a token used to obtain a new authentication token when the current one expires.

3) expiresAt: 
-Represents the instant at which the authentication token expires. 
-It's of type Instant, which is a precise point in time.

4) username: 
-Represents the username associated with the authentication response.


-In this context, Instant is used to store the exact moment in time when the authentication token expires (expiresAt). 
-This is a common practice in authentication systems to provide clients with information about the validity period of tokens. 
-Using Instant ensures that the expiration time is represented accurately and is independent of time zones or calendars.
