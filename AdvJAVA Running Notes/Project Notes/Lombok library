Lombok:

-Lombok is a Java library that aims to reduce boilerplate code in Java classes. 
-It provides a set of annotations that you can use in your code to automatically generate common methods and reduce the amount of repetitive code you need to write. 

Some of the key annotations provided by Lombok include:

1) @Getter and @Setter: 
-These annotations generate getter and setter methods for your class fields, respectively.

2) @ToString: 
-This annotation generates a toString() method for your class, which returns a string representation of the object, including all its fields.

3) @EqualsAndHashCode: 
-This annotation generates equals() and hashCode() methods based on the fields of your class. 
-It's useful for implementing the equals contract and for using objects in collections like HashSet and HashMap.

4) @NoArgsConstructor, @RequiredArgsConstructor, and @AllArgsConstructor: 
-These annotations generate constructors for your class. 
-@NoArgsConstructor creates a constructor with no arguments, 
-@RequiredArgsConstructor generates a constructor with arguments for all final fields, 
-@AllArgsConstructor generates a constructor with arguments for all fields.

5) @Builder: 
-This annotation generates a builder pattern for your class, allowing you to construct objects with a fluent API.

6) @Data: 
-As mentioned earlier, this annotation is a shortcut for @Getter, @Setter, @ToString, @EqualsAndHashCode, and @RequiredArgsConstructor combined. 
-It generates all these methods for your class.

-These are just a few of the annotations provided by Lombok. There are several others, each serving a specific purpose to help you reduce boilerplate code and make your Java code more concise and readable.
