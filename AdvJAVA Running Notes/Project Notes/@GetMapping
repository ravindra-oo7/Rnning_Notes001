@GetMapping :


-The @GetMapping annotation in Spring MVC is a specialized form of the @RequestMapping annotation. 
-It is a shortcut for mapping HTTP GET requests onto specific handler methods within a controller.

Here's a breakdown of the @GetMapping annotation:

1) Value: 
-This attribute specifies the URL path or paths that the handler method will respond to. 
-For example, @GetMapping("/example") maps GET requests with the path "/example" to the annotated method.

2) Produces: 
-This attribute specifies the media types that the handler method produces. 
-It restricts the controller to return responses with content types that match the specified media types.

3) Other attributes: 
-Just like @RequestMapping, @GetMapping also supports attributes such as params and headers to further customize the mapping based on request parameters and headers.

-The @GetMapping annotation is concise and improves the readability of the code by explicitly indicating that the annotated method handles only HTTP GET requests. 
-It is commonly used when the controller method is intended to handle only GET requests, making the code more expressive and self-documenting.

Here's an example usage of @GetMapping:

java code

	import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
	import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

	@RestController
	public class ExampleController {

	    // Handles GET requests to "/example"
	    @GetMapping("/example")
	    public String handleGetRequest() {
		return "GET request handled!";
	    }
	}
	
	
-In this example, the handleGetRequest() method is annotated with @GetMapping("/example"), indicating that it handles HTTP GET requests to the "/example" path.
