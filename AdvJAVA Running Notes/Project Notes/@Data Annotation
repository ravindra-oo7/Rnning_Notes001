@Data Annotation:-

-The @Data annotation is part of the Project Lombok library for Java. 
-Lombok is a library that helps reduce boilerplate code in Java classes, particularly for data objects. 
-When you annotate a class with @Data, Lombok generates code for you, including getters, setters, equals(), hashCode(), and toString() methods, based on the fields in your class.

Here's a breakdown of what the @Data annotation does:

1) Getters and Setters: 
-Lombok generates getter and setter methods for each field in the class.

2) equals() and hashCode(): 
-Lombok generates methods to compare objects based on their fields for equality (equals()) and to generate hash codes (hashCode()).

3) toString(): 
-Lombok creates a toString() method that includes the class name and the values of all fields.

By using @Data, you can significantly reduce the amount of boilerplate code you need to write, making your code cleaner and more maintainable. 
-However, it's important to note that while Lombok can reduce the amount of code you write, it does add a layer of abstraction, which some developers might find less transparent. 
-Additionally, since Lombok modifies the bytecode of your classes during compilation, there could be implications for IDE support and debugging.
