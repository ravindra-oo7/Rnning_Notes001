@Email:

-The @Email annotation from jakarta.validation.constraints is used in Java applications, 
-particularly with frameworks like Jakarta Bean Validation (formerly known as Java EE Bean Validation), to validate email addresses.

Here's how it works:

1) Validation: 
-When you apply @Email annotation to a field, it tells the validation framework that the field must contain a valid email address.

2) Format Check: 
-The framework checks if the value of the field conforms to the standard email address format. 
-This includes checking for the presence of "@" symbol, domain name validity, etc.

3) Error Handling: 
-If the value fails the email format check, the framework throws a validation exception. 
-You can handle this exception according to your application's logic, such as displaying an error message to the user or logging the issue.

Here's an example of how you might use @Email annotation:

java code

	import jakarta.validation.constraints.Email;
	import jakarta.validation.constraints.NotBlank;

	public class User {
	    @NotBlank
	    private String name;

	    @Email
	    private String email;

	    // Constructor, getters, setters
	}


In this example:

-The name field is annotated with @NotBlank, indicating that it must not be blank.
-The email field is annotated with @Email, indicating that it must be a valid email address format.
-Using @Email helps ensure that the email addresses entered by users follow a standard format, reducing errors and improving the overall quality of your application's data.
